Write a generic class named MyList, with a type parameter T. The type parameter T should be constrained to an upper bound: the Number class. The class should have as a field an ArrayList of T. Write a public method named add, which accepts a parameter of typeÂ T. When an argument is passed to the method, it is added to the ArrayList. Write two other methods, smallest and largest, which return the largest and smallest values in the ArrayList.
